# dug

[![Build Status](https://drone.unfrl.com/api/badges/unfrl/dug/status.svg)](https://drone.unfrl.com/unfrl/dug)

A powerful global DNS progagation checker that can output in a variety of formats.

The goal of dug is to make it easy to check the propagation of DNS records. It is also capable of providing templated output that can be used in scripts for things like monitoring.

For detailed documentation check out [dug.unfrl.com](https://dug.unfrl.com)

## Usage
The easiest way to explore dug is through the help.
* `dug help` -> Get top level help explaining the different verbs
* `dug help run` or `dug run --help` -> Get details about a specific verb (run, which is the default)
* `dug help update` or `dug update --help` -> Get details about the update verb

The simplest way to get started is to just run a query against the domain whose DNS records you're updating.
For example: `dug git.kaijucode.com`:

You can also do complicated things like ask for specific record types, get the output as json, and pipe it into other applications: `dug git.kaijucode.com -q A --output-format JSON --output-template Ipaddress,city,value,responsetime | jq`:

### Arch

A friend put dug in the AUR! [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/dug-git/)

### Snap

Run `snap install unfrl-dug`

Note: Annoying `dug` is a reserved package name and I am waiting for them to give it to me. In the meantime in order to run dug after installing it as specified above you should run: `unfrl-dug.dug ...`

### Docker

Not sure if this counts as an "Installation" but there is a docker image available [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/unfrl/dug)

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/unfrl/dug/releases/latest) and download the osx binary.

2. You should be able to download that, make is executable, and run it from the terminal. Then you can put it somewhere and update your path so you can execute it from anywhere.

### Windows

#### Chocolatey (choco cli)
> Chocolatey manually reviews all packages, which takes a while, so this can lag behind the latest. [status info here](https://chocolatey.org/packages/dug)
1. Run: `choco install dug`

#### Executable
1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/unfrl/dug/releases/latest) and download the .exe binary.

2. You should be able to download that and run it from the terminal. Then you can put it somewhere and update your path so you can execute it from anywhere.

## Development

This is a .net 5 project, so as long as you have the dotnet cli, available [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) you should be able to do the following: `dotnet build ./cli`

The project was developed in VSCode so the debugger profiles that I have used are available if you're also using VSCode.

## License
The license used by dug, [here](./cli/LICENSE), is very explicitly designed to try to keep capitalists from benefiting from this tool. This is not a traditional license but it is very simple, please read it.
